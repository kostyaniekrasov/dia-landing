## Landing Page Description
This landing page is for "Air," a full-service creative agency that focuses on branding, communication, and strategic business growth. 
The site outlines their services, including brand development, content production, marketing strategy, and digital communications. 
It also features client testimonials and an overview of the agency's approach to combining deep analytics, strong strategy, and creative ideas.

## What I learned
 #### Responsive Design: Using CSS Grid and Flexbox for adaptable layouts.
 #### Sass: Structuring styles with the preprocessor for better code organization and reuse.
 #### Animations and Interactions: Implementing pseudo-elements and transitions for smooth animations.
 #### Client Testimonials Integration: Effectively showcasing client feedback.
